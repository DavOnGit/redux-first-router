// PRIMARY FACADE METHODS:

// Below is the facade around both `sessionStorage` and our `history-storage` fallback.
// Essentially the idea is that if there is no `sessionStorage`, we maintain the entire
// storage object on EACH AND EVERY history entry's `state`. I.e. `history.state` on
// every page will have the `index` and `entries` array. That way when browsers disable
// cookies/sessionStorage, we can still grab the data we need off off of history state :)
//
// It's a bit crazy, but it works very well, and there's plenty of space allowed for storing
// things there to get a lot of mileage out of it. Firefox has the lowest limit of 640kb per
// entry. IE has 1mb and chrome has at least 10mb:
// https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6460377/html5-history-api-what-is-the-max-size-the-state-object-can-be

// called every time the history entries or index changes
export const saveHistory = ({ index, entries }) => {
  entries = entries.map(e => ({
    url: e.url,
    key: e.key,
    state: e.state,
    basename: e.basename
  }))

  const history = { index, entries }

  // here's the key aspect of the fallback. essentially we keep updating history state
  // via `replaceState` so every entry has everything that would be in `sessionStorage`
  if (!hasSessionStorage()) {
    const state = getHistoryState()

    // which also won't need to remember state, as iframes usually aren't for navigating
    // to other sites. IE11 should generally work fine when navigating to and from your site.
    return {}
  }
}

// this is a key one, as it sets the id in history.state for the first entry
// that way the `id` can be used to differentiate between different sessionStorages
// that could happen in the same tab if you manually enter another URL at your site.
// It's a bit complex, but basically we use an id from history state to discover
// multiple possible available sessionStorages lol. Yes, our ware is robust :)

// FACADE HELPERS:

const getIndexAndEntries = (history, routes, opts) => {
  let { index, entries } = history

  // We must remove entries after the index in case the user opened a link to
  // another site in the middle of the entries stack and then returned via the
  // back button, in which case the entries are gone for good, like a `push`.
  // NOTE: we currently don't re-save the sliced array, as it will be saved
  // on any future change--because if the user, for example, refreshed, the
  // same thing would happen.
  //
  // EXCEPTION: if we did this on the first entry, we would break backing out of the
  // site and returning. So this is only applied to essentially "forwarding out" of
  // the site. That leaves one hole: if you forward out from the first entry, you will
  // return and have dead entries (if you had additional entries). But this isn't really
  // a hole--because if you use the forward browser button to go forward, you in fact
  // leave the site. That leaves only one thing that can happen anyway: pushing new entries within your site.
  // Now, if you are using the `next` method manually, even if you check `canGo`,
  // you will think you can go to the next internal entry, but you will in fact send the
  // user to the next site lol. You aren't supposed to use that method, but with upcoming
  // web-based navigators, it may become more popular. When that happens, we'll do this for you:
  // set the below variable `__forwardedOut` to true before following links, by monkey-patching
  // `Event.prototype.preventDefault` to store this fact in `sessionStorage`, and then on load`,
  // set `window.__forwardedOut` to true. If you're OCD, you can do it in user-land now :)
  if (index > 0 || window.__forwardedOut) {
    entries = entries.slice(0, index + 1)
  }

  entries = entries.map(e => {
    const path = e.url.replace(e.basename, '')
    const entry = { ...e, ...parsePath(path) }
    return createAction(entry, routes, opts)
  })
  return { index, entries }
}

let _id

const getId = () => {
  _id = _id || getHistoryState().id || 'id' // sessions when using memory history won't be able to have unique IDs
  return `${_id}/`
